# Somniphobia Alpha Release 
Welcome to Somniphobia! Control the characters using the following control scheme:

Left/Right arrow keys: Move left/right
Up arrow key: Jump
Space + arrow keys: Dash in direction of arrow keys (8 directions)
E: Toggle holding hands
Q: Switch between our two characters Somni and Phobia

The goal of this game is to get both Somni and Phobia to the red exit door while holding hands. Somni can interact with light platforms and Phobia can interact with dark platforms. The combined platforms can interact with both characters. The movement and jumping are the standard movements for 2d platformers. Dashing can be done in eight possible directions: the four cardinal directions as well as diagonally if two arrow keys are held at once. Somni and Phobia are able to hold hands if they are close enough to each other. Switching will either allow the player to control the opposite character or switch the leading character if they are holding hands. When a dash is performed while holding hands, the leading character is propelled in a dashing movement while the other character is left behind. One propel and one dash is able to be performed before a character touches the ground.

You can navigate between the levels using 'N' and 'P'
